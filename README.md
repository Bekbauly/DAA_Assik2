Assignment 2 â€“ Advanced Sorting Algorithms

Student A: Galymzhan Bekbauly
Algorithm: Shell Sort (Shell, Knuth, and Sedgewick gap sequences)

1 Algorithm Overview

Shell Sort is an improved version of Insertion Sort that allows exchanging elements that are far apart.
It works by sorting elements at a certain gap distance apart, then gradually reducing the gap until it becomes 1.
This improves efficiency for medium and large arrays.

Implemented gap sequences:

Shellâ€™s sequence â€“ n/2, n/4, â€¦, 1

Knuthâ€™s sequence â€“ (3^k - 1) / 2

Sedgewickâ€™s sequence â€“ hybrid sequence with theoretical O(n^(4/3)) performance

2 Complexity Analysis
Case	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Best	Î©(n log n)	O(1)
Average	Î˜(n^1.25)	O(1)
Worst	O(nÂ²)	O(1)

Shell Sort is in-place, requiring no additional memory beyond a few variables.

3 Experimental Results
Sequence	n	Avg Time (ms)	Comparisons	Swaps	Array Accesses
SHELL	10,000	4	263,000	150,000	650,000
KNUTH	10,000	3	239,000	168,000	560,000
SEDGEWICK	10,000	2	197,000	109,000	490,000

Note: The values above are the average of three runs on random data.
Detailed raw results are available in docs/results.csv.

4 Analysis

Based on the benchmark results:

Sedgewickâ€™s gap sequence achieved the best performance â€” fastest execution and fewest operations.

Knuthâ€™s sequence performed slightly slower but still much better than the original Shellâ€™s.

Shellâ€™s sequence had the highest time and operation count.

These findings match the theoretical predictions: better-designed gap sequences reduce both time and cache misses.

6 Conclusion

Among the three tested gap sequences, Sedgewickâ€™s sequence provided the best balance of speed and efficiency.
The empirical measurements confirm the theoretical complexity analysis.
This implementation demonstrates how gap optimization can significantly improve sorting performance.
