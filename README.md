Shell Sort Algorithm - Report

Student B, Pair 2: Advanced Sorting Algorithms
Algorithm: Shell Sort with Multiple Gap Sequences (Shell, Knuth, Sedgewick)

üìã Algorithm Overview

Shell Sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that generalizes insertion sort to allow the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm improves on insertion sort by allowing the comparison and exchange of elements that are distant from each other, reducing the amount of shifting needed when compared to the standard insertion sort.

Key Features:

‚úÖ In-place sorting: O(1) auxiliary space.

‚úÖ Multiple gap sequences: Uses Shell, Knuth, and Sedgewick gap sequences to optimize sorting performance.

‚úÖ Improved performance over Insertion Sort: Reduces the number of comparisons and swaps in practice.

‚úÖ Adaptable: You can experiment with different gap sequences for varying performance results.

üßÆ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:
Case	Complexity	Explanation
Best Case	Œò(n log n)	When the input is nearly sorted, Shell Sort is efficient with small gaps.
Average Case	Œò(n^3/2)	The performance improves with better gap sequences like Knuth or Sedgewick.
Worst Case	Œò(n^2)	For Shell's original gap sequence, the worst case performance is quadratic.
Why Œò(n^2) in the worst case?

Build heap: O(n) using the bottom-up approach.

Gap sequence: Performance depends on the sequence chosen. For Shell, the worst case is O(n^2), but for Knuth and Sedgewick, it can be much better.

Space Complexity:

Auxiliary Space: Œò(1) - sorts in-place.

Total Space: Œò(n) - input array only.

üìä Benchmark Graphs

From the CSV data, we can generate the following performance graphs:

Time vs Input Size

Comparisons vs Input Size

Swaps vs Input Size

These graphs help visualize how the algorithm performs as the input size grows.

üßë‚Äçüíª Unit Tests

The implementation is tested through various cases, including:

Empty array

Single element

Sorted array

Reversed array

Array with duplicates

Example Test Cases:
@Test
public void testEmpty() {
    int[] a = new int[0];
    PerformanceTracker pt = new PerformanceTracker();
    ShellSort.sort(a, ShellSort.GapSequence.SHELL, pt);
    assertEquals(0, a.length);
}

@Test
public void testSingle() {
    int[] a = new int[]{42};
    PerformanceTracker pt = new PerformanceTracker();
    ShellSort.sort(a, ShellSort.GapSequence.KNUTH, pt);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{42}, a);
}

@Test
public void testSorted() {
    int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    PerformanceTracker pt = new PerformanceTracker();
    ShellSort.sort(a, ShellSort.GapSequence.SEDGEWICK, pt);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, a);
}

üì¢ Conclusion

Shell Sort provides efficient O(n log n) sorting performance with in-place memory usage.

Performance Tracking helps identify key metrics, such as comparisons, swaps, and execution time.

The algorithm performs well across different distributions, including sorted, reversed, and nearly sorted arrays.
