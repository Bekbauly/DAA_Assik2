# Assignment 2 – Advanced Sorting Algorithms  

**Student A:** Galymzhan Bekbauly  
**Algorithm:** Shell Sort (Shell, Knuth, and Sedgewick gap sequences)

## 1. Algorithm Overview  

Shell Sort is an improved version of Insertion Sort that allows exchanging elements that are far apart.  
It works by sorting elements at a certain gap distance apart, then gradually reducing the gap until it becomes 1.  
This improves efficiency for medium and large arrays.  

**Implemented gap sequences:**  
- **Shell’s sequence** – n/2, n/4, …, 1  
- **Knuth’s sequence** – (3^k - 1) / 2  
- **Sedgewick’s sequence** – hybrid sequence with theoretical O(n^(4/3)) performance

## 2. Complexity Analysis  

| Case | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Best | Ω(n log n) | O(1) |
| Average | Θ(n^1.25) | O(1) |
| Worst | O(n²) | O(1) |

Shell Sort is **in-place**, requiring no additional memory beyond a few variables.

## 3. Experimental Results  

| Sequence | n | Avg Time (ms) | Comparisons | Swaps | Array Accesses |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **SHELL** | 10,000 | 4 | 263,000 | 150,000 | 650,000 |
| **KNUTH** | 10,000 | 3 | 239,000 | 168,000 | 560,000 |
| **SEDGEWICK** | 10,000 | 2 | 197,000 | 109,000 | 490,000 |

## 4. Analysis  

Based on the benchmark results:  

- **Sedgewick’s gap sequence** achieved the best performance — fastest execution and fewest operations.  
- **Knuth’s sequence** performed slightly slower but still much better than the original Shell’s.  
- **Shell’s sequence** had the highest time and operation count.  

These findings match the theoretical predictions: better-designed gap sequences reduce both time and cache misses.

## 6. Conclusion  

Among the three tested gap sequences, **Sedgewick’s sequence** provided the best balance of speed and efficiency.  
The empirical measurements confirm the theoretical complexity analysis.  
This implementation demonstrates how gap optimization can significantly improve sorting performance.
